            <h4>Slideshow</h4>
            <p>A slideshow will be implemented on two pages to showcase some information about the organization.The pages that they will 
                be on are the "Helping the Community" and "Services" page. I learned about the slideshow in the last assignment we had
                at this link from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow_gallery.asp">
                W3 Schools</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Forms</h4>
            <p>Forms will also be implemented on the page for the user to input there information. They will be implemented on the 
                "Contact Us" and "Volunteering Hours" page. I learned about the form from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8">
                FCC activities</a> and the activity we had earlier in the year on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://instructure.charlotte.edu/courses/239907/assignments/2423968?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Finstructure.charlotte.edu%2Fcalendar%23view_name%3Dmonth%26view_start%3D2025-04-26">Canvas</a>
            </p>
            <h4>Header and Footer Component</h4>
            <p>The header and footer components will be included using javascript. That way they don't need to be added  to each page individually
                and can be changed when I change the component. This will be placed on all the pages.
