        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.nike.com/tennis">Nike Tennis</a></h3>
            <p>This is the site for Nike's tennis brand. It has all things realted to tennis including ambassadors, clothing, shoes
                , equipment for all genders and sizes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CONTRAST: There is clear contrast using white and black font colors. Headings are clearly distuinshed from other elements
                    and places to shop are clearly labeled. Also the different pages are also clearly seen
                </li>
                <li>REPITITION: The same colors, structure, and components are used across the whole website. It is easy to read
                    and know where the flow of the page is going
                </li>
                <li>ALIGNMENT: There are clear margins to each page and each component is in its designated section. This way each portion
                    of the page is easily seen and easy to find for the user
                </li>
                <li>PROXIMITY: The Nike Tennis website does a good job of keeping each element a set distance away from each other. Doing
                    so makes the website pleasing to look at. The spacing between each element is also the same for all of the elements on
                    the page.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
            <p>This is the page for the Charlotte craigslist. It is like an Ebay but it is not a very good website and does not follow
                the CRAP principles. You can buy used items on the website as well as forums.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CONTRAST: There is ok contrast between all the elements. The same font color is used for the whole page making it hard to 
                    distinguish different elements apart. All of the different elements look the same making the headings and other links
                    hard to find.
                </li>
                <li>REPITITION: There is a lot of repitition, but not the good kind. All of the elements on the page follow the same form
                    of repitition. Nothing on the page is predictable since everything is the same.
                </li>
                <li>ALIGNMENT: The alignment on the page is not bad. Everything is in vertical columns and aligned and there seems to
                    be a flow to the page.
                </li>
                <li>PROXIMITY: The proximity of the page is not good. All of the elements on the page are the same distance away from
                    each other. The same type of elements don't seem to be grouped together making them the design of the page rather hard
                    to understand.
